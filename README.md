# SOEN341 Winter 2022

# Objective

Develop an e-commerce platform (a simplified version of Amazon).

# Project

Technology has elicited an evolution in consumer behaviour, leading to an escalation in the popularity of online shopping. This escalation is due to the fact that many consumers believe that online shopping is more convenient than physical store shopping, and allows for more control, easy price comparisons, and more product variety. This e-commerce website allows customers to reap the benefits of online shopping while browsing for available items, adding items to their shopping cart and checking out from the comfort of their own homes. Website features will be enhanced throughout the platform's development in order to optimize user experience.
